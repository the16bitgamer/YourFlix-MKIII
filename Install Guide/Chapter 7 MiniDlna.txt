---   Chapter 7 MiniDlna   ---

Now YourFlix is compatible with a lot of different devices via a web browsers. But there are some older devices, like the Sony PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 where it won't work, but it would be nice to have YourFlix on.

This is where MiniDlna comes in and can bridge the gap between intergenerational Devices, and this is just going to be a quick guide for setting it up and configuring it to automatically work.

1) Install MiniDlna
    :$ sudo apt install minidlna

2) Conifgure MiniDlna
    :$ sudo nano /etc/minidlna.conf
    
    Go through and enable set the following settings
        media_dir=/var/www/html/Videos
        merge_media_dirs=Yes
        root_container=B
        port=8200
        friendly_name=YourFlix MKIII
        inotify=yes

3) Restart MiniDLNA
    :$ sudo systemctl restart minidlna
    
MiniDLNA has now been configured and should work across all devices.
