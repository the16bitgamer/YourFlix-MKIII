---   Chapter 6 Apache2 and the YourFlix Web Server   ---

Now that the Pi is setup with everything that is needed to run YourFlix, all that's left to do is get the webhost working. We'll be using Apache2 as the web server and it's installed as easily as

:$ sudo apt-get install apache2

Next we need to take ownership of the html folder since by default it's given to root:

:$ sudo chown -R pi: /var/www/html

And for ease of convience I like to create a symlink of the html folder in my user directory

:$ ln -s /var/www/html ./html

And you will need to symlink our Videos directory to the html folder:

:$ ln -s /home/pi/Videos /var/www/html

This will allow us to access the external HDD on our server. In earlier implentations YourFlix streamed from source, however now YourFlix streams from the Gerbera server.

Next we need to enable the rewrite engine so we can run the entire website off of one html file.

:$ sudo a2enmod rewrite

next we need to update the default configuration to use rewriting so edit the following document:

:$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

and add the following:

<Directory "/var/www/html">
    RewriteEngine on
    # Don't rewrite files or directories
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
    RewriteRule ^ - [L]
    # Rewrite everything else to index.html to allow html5 state links
    RewriteRule ^ index.html [L]
</Directory>

finally restart apache2 with:

:$ sudo systemctl restart apache2

PHP

:$ sudo apt-get install php

sqlite
