---   Chapter 1 Setting up Your Raspberry Pi   ---

YourFlix is designed and tested to work on a Raspberry Pi, with Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian). This guide will show you how to install YourFlix from scratch.

If you are using another distro of Linux or have a Pi already setup Skip to Chapter 2.

If you are on Windows/Mac we don't have a guide for you yet... sorry. The software should still work, but I have yet to test for it, or create configuration untilities for it.


So to set up a raspberry pi:

1) Download Pi Imager
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

You can flash a Pi image yourself this tool is just a little bit easier to use.

2) Install/Run Pi Imager
   a) Select Raspberry Pi OS (Other)
   b) Raspberry Pi OS Lite
       The Desktop version of Pi OS has a bit more overhead than I like, you can use it if you want but it isn't necessary for this tutorial.
   c) Select SD Card you wish to install this on
       Current Guide is tested on a 2GB MicroSD card. You'll need more/external storage if you want to watch more than a few low res videos
   d) Write to the SD Card and wait until it finishes writing and verifiying the image

The SD Card is now setup next we need to plug it into the Pi and get it set up.

3) Plug in and log into Pi
   a) Plug in SD Card into Pi
   b) Plug Pi into a USB Power supply
   c) Connect Pi to a Minitor (via HDMI or other)
   d) Wait until login Prompt show up
       default user is: pi
       default password is: raspberry

4) Change Pi's Default Password (optional)

I'll highly recomend changing the password on your Pi. But it's not necessary.

   a) To change the password in a terminal type:
       :$ sudo raspi-config       
   b) Select '1 Change User Password Change password for the 'pi' user'
   c) Select 'Yes' and type in your new password twice.
   d) When done select 'Finish' by pressing Right twice.
   
Now that our Pi is setup and ready to go, we'll now move to Chapter 2 to configure the Network.
