---   Chapter 1 Raspberry Pi OS   ---

Now I am assuming you have yourself the Following:

- A Raspberry Pi
- An SD Card with enough storage to write the OS too
- The approperiate Power adapter
- Keyboard
- Monitor
- The Holy Grail
- A Computer/device which can write to an SD Card and download things from
- The Internet
- Time

So lets start by downloading our Raspberry Pi OS from [raspberrypi.org].(https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) I'll be downloading the lite image but it will work with a Desktop image too.
 
raspberrypi.org has a wonderful guide for [how to install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) the image.
 
So from the Guide figgure out how to unzip and burn the image to your Micro SD card and once done, put it into your Pi and plug in the power.

default user is: pi
default password is: raspberry

I'll highly recomend changing the password on your Pi. But it's not necessary.

To change the password in a terminal type:

:$ sudo raspi-conf

Then select '1 Change User Password Change password for the 'pi' user', select 'Yes' and type in your new password twice. When done select 'Finish' by pressing Right twice.
