---   Chapter 2 Setting up Network and SSH Server   ---

--  Chapter 2.1 Static IP for eth0  --

So now that Raspberry Pi OS is installed (I miss calling it Raspbain), it's time to configure your ethernet network with a static IP and enable the SSH Server. By default the ethernet is setup to a IP given to it by the router, but not knowing where our server is means it will be tricky to access YourFlix when you want to. So lets follow (this guide from raspberrypi.org)[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/tcpip/]

We are going to start by loging into our Pi, opening up a terminal and figguring out our current IP Address with the command:

:$ hostname -I

This will return a number like '192.168.0.35' we will need the first 3 numbers for this example '192.168.0'. Next we need to edit our network connect by modifiying the devices dhcpcd.conf by typing in:

:$ sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

Nano is our ternimal text editor, and in here we need to add the lines:

interface eth0
   static ip_address=192.168.0.155/24    
   static routers=192.168.0.1
   static domain_name_servers=192.168.0.1 8.8.8.8

Quick break down of the IP Address I have the PI. 192.168.0 is from earlier, and an IPv4 address can go up to 255, meaning it can support 255 devices. I doubt there will ever be 155 machines on my network. Static routers are typically the first device on a network i.e. XXX.XXX.X.1, and they can resolve domain name server (DNS) requests, but I also added Google's DNS 8.8.8.8 as a backup if it fails.

So when your done quit nano by pressing 'crtl'+'x' and save with 'y', and all that's left is to reset the network by running the commands:

sudo ifconfig eth0 down
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
sudo ifconfig

And you should now have your IP in my case 192.168.0.155 returned.

--  Chapter 2.2 Enabling SSH  --

Next task is a simple one, enabling open SSH so we can transfer files to it remotly on the same network or access the pi itself remotly, by following the guide on (raspberrypi.org)[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/]:

Enter in a terminal window:
:$  sudo raspi-config

Select '5. Interfacing Options',
then navigate to and select 'F2 SSH',
then choose 'Yes', next select 'Ok',

You've now enabled SSH on your Raspberry Pi, however something else we can do here if you wish is change the hostname of the device so we can access YourFlix via a web browser by just typing in 'yourflix.local'. If you want to do that:

Select '5. Network Options',
Then 'N1. Host Name',
Select 'OK',
Type in the hostname you want, I've used 'yourflix',
When done Select 'OK',

Now that we've set our hostname the pi needs to reset, but now all that's left is to quit the config by:

choosing 'Finish' by pressing Right twice.

Now that we have the SSH client installed you can access your Pi with a FTP server (with a sftp connection) or with a SSH client like Putty.

Just connect with 'pi@raspberrypi.local' or if you changed your hostname 'pi@yourflix.local' instead of the IP since that might change as you are going through the setup.
