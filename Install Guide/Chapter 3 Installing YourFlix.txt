---   Chapter 3 Installing YourFlix   ---

Before we can install YourFlix we need to first update and upgrade our software with:

:$ sudo apt update
:$ sudo apt upgrade

YourFlix relys on Apache2, PHP, and Python3 so if there are system resources which are out of date these might not work.

Now that the Pi is up to date lets download and install YourFlix

1) Download the lastest Release of YourFlix
    We can download to the Pi by getting the latest release from https://github.com/the16bitgamer/YourFlix-MKIII/releases copying the link and run the command
        :$ wget [LATEST RELEASE LINK HERE]

2) Install YourFlix by typing install
    :$ sudo apt install ./YourFlix
    
    and press the 'TAB' key to fill in the rest
    
    Now the YourFlix Webserver is live and working you can visit it by typing in your YourFlix server IP address into a web browser. The server isn't ready yet since we need to enable rewrite but that's covered in Chapter 5

3) Once installed you need to restart the reload the deamon serveice and enable YourFlix Auto Scan script, to automatically build and populate the sqlite database
    :$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    :$ sudo systemctl enable yourflix
    :$ sudo systemctl start yourflix

4) FTP YourFlix Programs into Videos Folder and it should automagically add itself.

    See chapter 4 to know how to make a YourFlix Program.
