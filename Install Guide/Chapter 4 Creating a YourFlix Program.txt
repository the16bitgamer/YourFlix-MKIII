---   Chapter 4 Creating a YourFlix Program   ---

The File Folder Structure in YourFlix is critical for the operation of the Service since if it's not set up correctly it either wont work, or it'll be missing items.

So Where do your Video Folders live for YourFlix?

By default YourFlix will scan a Folder in /var/www/html called Videos/ and inside Videos/ you'll have even more Folders.

A Folder inside of the Root of the scanned Folder is called a Program, and Videos/Pictures inside a Program Folder is called Content.

Content cannot exist outside of a Program Folder, and a Program will not be visible without content (though it will exist)

So lets say we are adding the Disney Classic "Bambi" to YourFlix. This is how it should look on the server:

Videos/ -> Bambi/ -> Bambi.mp4
                    
So you've done that and oh no there's no Image of Bamb, but a coloured square, how does one add Images for the Programs?

Well all you'll need to do is Create another Folder inside the Program Folder called "YF-META", this meta folder will contain meta data, images, and even video. But at the moment only images are supported.

So inside YF-META just place a picture of any size into the folder in a supported HTML5 video type and it'll show up. (JPG, PNG, etc.)

So now your Bambi Program looks like

Videos/ -> Bambi/ -> YF-META/ -> Bambi.png
                  -> Bambi.mp4
                  
Cool but I have a TV Show with lots of Videos, how do I add that?

Well you could just dump them into the Program Folder, but a Program can have a Folder, infact a Program is a Folder. But a Folder must have content before it shows up.

So lets say we have a TV Show like Avatar and we wanted to add all 3 Seasons of the show. It will look like this:

Videos/ -> Avatar/ -> YF-META/ -> Avatar_The_Last_Airbener.png

                   -> Season 1/ -> E01.mp4
                                -> E02.mp4
                                -> ...
                                -> E19.mp4
                                -> E20.mp4
                                
                   -> Season 2/ -> E01.mp4
                                -> E02.mp4
                                -> ...
                                -> E19.mp4
                                -> E20.mp4

                   -> Season 3/ -> E01.mp4
                                -> E02.mp4
                                -> ...
                                -> E20.mp4
                                -> E21.mp4

Now that you know how to add Programs to YourFlix, here a few tricks.

If you mounted your HDD elsewhere on your device you can use a symlink to move it to the HDD with the command:

$ln -s <path to the file/folder to be linked> <the path of the link to be created>

There is a config file located in /etc/yourflix/yourflix.config which the programs loads on start which loads in all the supported files and the location of folders, so if you want to rename the YF-META to something else or have your videos located elsewhere, you can change it there.

The config also hosts the supported file types, and if you want YourFlix to support more video types, you can update it there.
