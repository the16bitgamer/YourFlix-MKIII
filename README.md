# YourFlix-MKIII
Rev.3 of the YourFlix Web server now built in react.

YourFlix is a combination of webcode, server side scripts, and servers to allow you to browse and view your entire video library from a local web server, in my case a Raspberry Pi 3

The webcode is designed to that it can be used with legacy web browsers found on such devices like the New Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. And it's designed to work on Web Browsers which only has controller inputs like the PlayStation 4.

I will include instructions for how to set up your own YourFlix Server running Linux with install instructions for each component, since a YourFlix Server can be more than just serving Video Content in a browser.

Or if you wish to just download a preconfigured YourFlix Server I will have links for a Raspberry Pi OS Lite package preconfigured.
