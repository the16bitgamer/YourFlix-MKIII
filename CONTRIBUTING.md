Thank you if you are interested in contributing to YourFlix MKIII, though I have grand ambitions for the project, my time sadly cannot revolve entirly around this.

Eventually I will add a Formatting Guidelines, but if you want to get a start, just look at how it's done in any of my Python scripts, or in my JavaScript code. It's not consistant but it'll do.

When Commiting Please have a detailed and clear commit, and add into the message what the intention of the update is. I will review it and give feedback.
